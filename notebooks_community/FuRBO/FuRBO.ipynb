    "# Feasibility-driven trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contributors: paoloascia, elenaraponi\n",
    "- Last update 19 December 2025\n",
    "- BoTorch version: 0.16.1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to implement the Feasibility-driven trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) [1] algorithm in a closed loop, with restarts. This is a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm developed specifically to handle severely constrained problems, while still performing well in simpler settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature of FuRBO is the new definition of the trust region. At each iteration, we define the trust regions as a hyper-rectangle encapsulating subregions of the search space predicted to be promising by the Gaussian process regression (GPR) models of the objective and constraints. Compared to other trust-region-based methods, such as Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SCBO) [2], FuRBO offers higher flexibility in how the trust region evolves. Its position and shape adapt dynamically to the regions predicted to be both feasible and optimal, allowing the search to align with the structure of the GP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of mildly constrained scenarios, the new definition of the trust region is advantageous when several samples are evaluated at each iteration (batches). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we recommend using FuRBO when solving:\n",
    "  - high-dimensional constrained black-box problems;\n",
    "  - severely constrained black-box problems of any dimension D;\n",
    "  - constrained problems evaluated with large batch sizes (i.e., bigger than 1D).\n",

    "\n",
    "Tho show the implementation of FuRBO, we use a 20D Ackley function on the domain $[−5,10]^{10}$ subject to two constraint functions $c_1$ and $c_2$. The problem maximizes the Ackley function under the constraints $c_1(x) \\leq 0$ and $c_2(x) \\leq 0$. The Ackley function is translated in every dimension, so that the optimum of the unconstrained problem lies outside of the feasible area. Since this problem presents only two constraints, we showcase the performance with a batch of $q = 3D = 30$."

    "\n",
    "1. Sample GPR surrogates <br>\n",
    "    - Draw ```n_samples``` with a uniform distribution in a sphere centred in $x_{best}$ and of radius $\\mathcal{R}$<br>\n",
    "    - Evaluate the samples on the GPR surrogates<br>\n",
    "2. Rank samples <br>\n",
    "    - Rank the samples based on optimality and feasibility: <br>\n",
    "      - first come all feasible samples in order of optimality <br>\n",
    "      - second come the infeasible samples ranked based on the total violation <br>\n",
    "3. Define trust region <br>\n",
    "    - Select the top P% ranked samples <br>\n",
    "    - Find the samllest hyper-rectangle that includes all selected samples <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is performed by the function ```multivariate_circular```. ```update_tr``` calls ```multivariate_circular``` and performs steps 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition yields two main properties:\n",
    "1. The trust region can jump across the entire domain since it is defined based on the posterior of the GPR models instead of the current best evaluated sample, as SCBO[2] or TuRBO[3].\n",
    "2. The trust region shape adapts to the most promising area according to the GPR models of objective and constraints, e.g., if the promising area is narrow and long, the trust region will also be narrow and long.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the trust region is defined with its sides parallel to the axes. Further improvements could be expected by allowing the trust region to rotate and allign with the feasible area.\n",
