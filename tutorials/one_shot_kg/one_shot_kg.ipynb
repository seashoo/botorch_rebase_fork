    "## The one-shot Knowledge Gradient acquisition function\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Knowledge Gradient* (KG) (see [2, 3]) is a look-ahead acquisition function that quantifies the expected increase in the maximum of the modeled black-box function $f$ from obtaining additional (random) observations collected at the candidate set $\\mathbf{x}$. KG often shows improved Bayesian Optimization performance relative to simpler acquisition functions such as Expected Improvement, but in its traditional form it is computationally expensive and hard to implement.\n",

    "In general, we recommend using [Ax](https://ax.dev) for a simple BO setup like this one, since this will simplify your setup (including the amount of code you need to write) considerably. You can use a custom BoTorch model and acquisition function in Ax, following Ax's [Modular BoTorch tutorial](https://ax.dev/docs/tutorials/modular_botorch/) tutorial. To use the KG acquisition function, it is sufficient to add `\"botorch_acqf_class\": qKnowledgeGradient,` to `model_kwargs`. The linked tutorial shows how to use a custom BoTorch model. If you'd like to let Ax choose which model to use based on the properties of the search space, you can skip the `surrogate` argument in `model_kwargs`.\n",

    "#### Optimizing KG\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional approach for optimizing parallel KG (where $g(\\xi) = \\xi$) is to apply stochastic gradient ascent, with each gradient observation potentially being an average over multiple samples. For each sample $i$, the inner optimization problem $\\max_{x_i \\in \\mathbb{X}} \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\xi^i \\mid \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbf{x}}^i \\right]$ for the posterior mean is solved numerically. An unbiased stochastic gradient of KG can then be computed by leveraging the envelope theorem and the optimal points $\\{x_i^*\\}$. In this approach, every iteration requires solving numerous inner optimization problems, one for each outer sample, in order to estimate just one stochastic gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"one-shot\" formulation of KG in BoTorch treats optimizing $\\alpha_{\\text{KG}}(\\mathbf{x})$ as an entirely deterministic optimization problem. It involves drawing $N_{\\!f} = $ `num_fantasies` fixed base samples $\\mathbf{Z}_f:= \\{ \\mathbf{Z}^i_f \\}_{1\\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$ for the outer expectation, sampling fantasy data $\\{\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbf{x}}^i(\\mathbf{Z}_f^i)\\}_{1\\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$, and constructing associated fantasy models $\\{\\mathcal{M}^i(\\mathbf{Z}_f^i)\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$. The inner maximization can then be moved outside of the sample average, resulting in the following optimization problem:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{X}}\\alpha_{\\text{KG}}(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\max_{\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{X}, \\mathbf{X}' \\in \\mathbb{X}^{N_{\\!f}} } %=1}^{\\!N_{\\!f}}}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\!f}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[g(\\xi^i)\\right],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\xi^i \\sim \\mathcal{P}(f(x'^i) \\mid \\mathcal{D} \\cup \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbf{x}}^i(\\mathbf{Z}_f^i))$ and $\\mathbf{X}' := \\{x'^i\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq N_{\\!f}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the inner expectation does not have an analytic expression, one can also draw fixed base samples $\\mathbf{Z}_I:= \\{ \\mathbf{Z}^i_I \\}_{1\\leq i\\leq N_{\\!I}}$ and use an MC approximation as with the standard MC acquisition functions of type `MCAcquisitionFunction`. In either case one is left with a deterministic optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference from the envelope theorem approach is that we do not solve the inner optimization problem to completion for every fantasy point for every gradient step with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$. Instead, we solve the nested optimization problem jointly over $\\mathbf{x}$ and the fantasy points $\\mathbf{X}'$. The resulting optimization problem is of higher dimension, namely $(q + N_{\\!f})d$ instead of $qd$, but unlike the envelope theorem formulation it can be solved as a single optimization problem, which can be solved using standard methods for deterministic optimization. \n",
